In order to get Movie info, for now, the movies will be hardcoded until the following solution can be implemented:

Using an open-source (available to all) database of movies that is published online, we will extract the relevant
data for all movies that the theater(s) is currently showing and display it in the endpoint (what you as the user will see).
